How is content ingested?

Content is ingested through an automatically scaling ingest system.

What happens if there is no instant ingest capacity available?

In the case of no instant ingest capacity available, please allow for up to 30 minutes for the scale-up to happen.

What will be the status of content during the scale-up time period?

During the scale-up time period, content would be listed normally (appearing in the Ingest Status tab of Nimbus UI), but its progress would only continue after the aforementioned scale-up time period.
